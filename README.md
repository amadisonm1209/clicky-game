 # Instructions:
 Upon opening, you're greeted with 12 Wes Anderson characters. Start clicking! The name of the game is to rememeber which picture you've clicked before and try to not click on that one again! It's kind of like a game of memory. The pictures shuffle after each click and your score is kept at the top.
